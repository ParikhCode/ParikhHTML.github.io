		<h1> Origin <img src="state3.png" alt="New Jersey" width="100" height="125" align="right"/> </h1></h1>
		
		<p> I was orginally born in New Jersey. However, when I was about 4 years old, my family moved to Luray, Virginia where I was raised for the rest of my life. While growing up, 
		I had a difficult time learning English as a second langauge, considering that Gujarati (Indo-Aryan language) was my native language. By the time I was a junior in high school
		my family had to move to Winchester, Virginia. It was here where I received my Advanced Diploma from Millbrook High School.
